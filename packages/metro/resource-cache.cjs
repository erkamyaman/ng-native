/**
 * A component's cached transform, served only while its external templates and stylesheets are as
 * they were when it was made.
 *
 * Metro keys a cached transform on the file's own content, and a component's template and sheet
 * are compiled into its own module. So a template or stylesheet edited on its own left the
 * component's key where it was, and a release build from a warm cache shipped what the component
 * looked like the last time its own file changed: two `npx expo export` runs, the same bundle, and
 * only `--clear` showed the edit. A dev server is not caught out, because the resource's own module
 * carries the edit there (see `resourceBlock`), but a release build empties that module.
 *
 * The transform worker writes down each resource a transform read and a hash of its text, and the
 * cache stores Metro is given read that back: a transform whose resources have changed, or gone,
 * is a miss, so Metro transforms the file again and writes the new one over it under the same key.
 * The cache is the only thing Metro asks before it reuses a transform, so it is the only place the
 * check can go. Expo does the same for a stylesheet Tailwind reads the whole project for, with a
 * `skipCache` its own stores look at; this keeps the cache, and works with any store.
 *
 * A running dev server asks no cache: it keeps each module it transformed in its graph, and
 * transforms one again only when that file changes. So a dev server holds the same list on each
 * module of its graph, and transforms again a module whose resources have changed, or gone,
 * before it answers a bundle request or sends a hot update: see `rereadingResources`.

/**
 * A dev server that transforms again each module of a graph whose resources have changed, or gone,
 * whenever it works out what changed in that graph: for a bundle request, a reload's or a
 * relaunch's, and for a hot update.
 *
 * Metro hears of the edit to a template, but transforms again only the template's own module, and
 * a component compiled with the template kept the old one until its own file changed. A touch that
 * keeps the file's text is not a change to Metro either. So two things are added to the server:
 *
 * - The modules made from a changed resource are added to the files the graph's calculator holds
 *   as changed, as Expo adds the modules an environment variable it read has changed under, and
 *   Metro transforms them as if they had been saved. The cache stores above find them stale too.
 * - Each transform's key names the resources it was made from. Metro keeps the module it has when
 *   a new transform comes back under the same key, which one of an unchanged file always did, so
 *   the component compiled again was dropped for the one it replaced. Expo varies the key the same
 *   way for what its transforms read from the environment.
 *
 * Metro has no public way in, so this reads the calculator of each graph and the files it holds as
 * changed, which Metro has kept under these names for years and Expo reads as well. A Metro
 * without them is left as it is, said once: an edit to only a template then reaches a running app
 * through the template's own module alone.
