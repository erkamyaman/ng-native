/**
 * A component's cached transform, served only while its external templates and stylesheets are as
 * they were when it was made.
 *
 * Metro keys a cached transform on the file's own content, and a component's template and sheet
 * are compiled into its own module. So a template or stylesheet edited on its own left the
 * component's key where it was, and a release build from a warm cache shipped what the component
 * looked like the last time its own file changed: two `npx expo export` runs, the same bundle, and
 * only `--clear` showed the edit. A dev server is not caught out, because the resource's own module
 * carries the edit there (see `resourceBlock`), but a release build empties that module.
 *
 * The transform worker writes down each resource a transform read and a hash of its text, and the
 * cache stores Metro is given read that back: a transform whose resources have changed, or gone,
 * is a miss, so Metro transforms the file again and writes the new one over it under the same key.
 * The cache is the only thing Metro asks before it reuses a transform, so it is the only place the
 * check can go. Expo does the same for a stylesheet Tailwind reads the whole project for, with a
 * `skipCache` its own stores look at; this keeps the cache, and works with any store.
