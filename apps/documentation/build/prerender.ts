/**
 * Snapshot prerendering: `vite build` produces the application, this walks it in a browser and
 * writes what each route drew back to disk, so a request for `/packages/components/touch` answers
 * with that page's prose instead of an empty `<app-root>`.
 *
 * A browser, rather than `@angular/ssr` or Analog, because of Babel: `@angular/build`,
 * `@angular/compiler-cli` and `@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular` all depend on `@babel/core@^8`,
 * React Native declares `@babel/core` as a peer with no range at all, and pnpm answers an
 * unconstrained peer with the highest copy in the workspace. Installing any of them moves Metro and
 * every `@react-native/babel-*` plugin onto a Babel major none of them supports, and scoped
 * `overrides` do not help because auto-installed peers ignore them. Playwright
 * is already here for `packages/web`'s browser suite, it has no Babel in its graph, and a headless
 * Chromium renders this site exactly as a reader's browser would - including the parts of it that
 * only a real layout engine can produce.
 *
 * The output is `dist/<route>.html`, which Cloudflare Pages serves at `/<route>` itself. A
 * `dist/<route>/index.html` would be served at `/<route>/` instead, with a 308 from the slashless
 * address every canonical URL, sitemap entry and internal link uses. The home page overwrites
 * `dist/index.html`, which stays the SPA fallback for anything unmatched, and this also writes `dist/404.html`, `dist/sitemap.xml` and `dist/robots.txt` - see the bottom of
 * this file.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately not in a snapshot:
 *
 * - **The live examples.** Each one is a `mount` island rendering `<view>` and `<text>`, element
 *   names no browser knows and no crawler can read. They are emptied here and mount on the client,
 *   which is the only place they can run. The prose around them is the point of this file.
 * - **A theme.** `index.html`'s pre-paint script decides `dark` from the reader's own storage and
 *   system preference, so the class must not be baked. The head below comes from the built
 *   `index.html` untouched rather than from the browser, which settles it by construction.
 * - **The head Vite rewrites at runtime.** Loading a lazy chunk appends a `<link rel="modulepreload">
 *   href="http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...">` naming this script's own throwaway server. Taking the
 *   built head instead of the rendered one keeps that out, at the cost of the preload hints a
 *   snapshot could otherwise have carried.
 *
 * Angular is bootstrapped without `provideClientHydration`, and that is the right pairing for a
 * snapshot: hydration reads the `ngh` annotations only `@angular/platform-server` emits, and given
 * markup without them it leaves the existing DOM in place and renders beside it, so the page ends
 * up with two of everything. Without it `bootstrapApplication` clears the host element first, which
 * makes the snapshot inert markup the application replaces. That costs a re-render on boot and buys
 * served HTML that is correct for every reader, which is the trade this file exists to make.
 *
 * A page's title, description, canonical URL, Open Graph/Twitter tags and structured data are not
 * baked from anything this file computes either: `src/seo.ts` sets them at runtime from `landing/landing.ts`'s
 * own copy or a document's front matter, the same code path a client navigation runs, and this file
 * only reads them back out of `document.head` once a route has settled - see `render()`.
